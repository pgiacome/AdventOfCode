write a net core program that solve the followoing puzzle "The computer appears to be trying to run a program, but its memory (your puzzle input) is corrupted. All of the instructions have been jumbled up!

It seems like the goal of the program is just to multiply some numbers. It does that with instructions like mul(X,Y), where X and Y are each 1-3 digit numbers. For instance, mul(44,46) multiplies 44 by 46 to get a result of 2024. Similarly, mul(123,4) would multiply 123 by 4.

However, because the program's memory has been corrupted, there are also many invalid characters that should be ignored, even if they look like part of a mul instruction. Sequences like mul(4*, mul(6,9!, ?(12,34), or mul ( 2 , 4 ) do nothing.

For example, consider the following section of corrupted memory:

xmul(2,4)%&mul[3,7]!@^do_not_mul(5,5)+mul(32,64]then(mul(11,8)mul(8,5))
Only the four highlighted sections are real mul instructions. Adding up the result of each instruction produces 161 (2*4 + 5*5 + 11*8 + 8*5).

Scan the corrupted memory for uncorrupted mul instructions. What do you get if you add up all of the results of the multiplications?" using thi s file as puzzle inputinput03 1.txt

Sure, I can help you with that! Here's a .NET Core program that scans the corrupted memory for valid `mul(X,Y)` instructions and sums up the results of the multiplications:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Read the input file
        string input = File.ReadAllText("input03 1.txt");

        // Define the regex pattern to match valid mul(X,Y) instructions
        string pattern = @"mul\((\d{1,3}),(\d{1,3})\)";
        Regex regex = new Regex(pattern);

        // Find all matches in the input
        MatchCollection matches = regex.Matches(input);

        // Initialize the sum
        int sum = 0;

        // Process each match
        foreach (Match match in matches)
        {
            // Extract the numbers from the match
            int x = int.Parse(match.Groups[1].Value);
            int y = int.Parse(match.Groups[2].Value);

            // Multiply the numbers and add to the sum
            sum += x * y;
        }

        // Output the result
        Console.WriteLine($"The sum of all valid multiplications is: {sum}");
    }
}
```

This program reads the contents of the file `input03 1.txt`, uses a regular expression to find all valid `mul(X,Y)` instructions, extracts the numbers, performs the multiplications, and sums up the results. Finally, it prints the sum.

Make sure to place the `input03 1.txt` file in the same directory as the program or provide the correct path to the file. You can run this program using the .NET Core CLI or an IDE like Visual Studio. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
